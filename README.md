# The botbots dataset

A dataset with dialogues between two instances of a conversational agent (ChatGPT or GPT-4).

The dataset covers a wide range of contexts (questions and answers, arguing and reasoning, task-oriented dialogues) and downstream tasks (e.g., hotel reservations, medical advice). It is generated with [datasetGPT](https://github.com/radi-cho/datasetGPT) and the [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use) as a backend.
