To pivot the campaign, we conducted market research to identify gaps in the competitor's product and then we leveraged those gaps to position our product as the superior choice. We also reworked our messaging and visuals to emphasize our unique selling points. Finally, we shifted our focus to different marketing channels, such as email marketing and influencer partnerships, to reach our target audience more effectively.
