At the end of the lease, you can either return the car to the dealership or purchase it outright.\n\nLeasing terms and conditions can vary depending on the specific car and lease agreement, but in general, leasing offers lower monthly payments than traditional financing because you're only paying for the car's depreciation during the lease term, not the full value of the car.
